# Anfho Snake Game

This game was made only with JS, NPM and Webpack and to manage the canvas we use JQuery

# How to run it!
If you download the code you have to run:
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
  
If you just want to run it in a browser you can use the dist folder and open the index.html file, other way to do that is to run *npm build* and opening the index file created in the dist folder. 

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
